(this is the public version, the newest one have dark-theme ui aswell as app logo. didnt sure when will i upload it)


this project is based on https://github.com/Blacklock/gtautofarmer 
and https://github.com/rvknth043/Global-Low-Level-Key-Board-And-Mouse-Hook

 
# Now you maybe ask how did i "fix" it?
well first of all i disabled the KeyboardHook since it was unnecessary for me, then fixed the active/deactive button aswell as adding hotkeys. simple stuff but useful (for me)
