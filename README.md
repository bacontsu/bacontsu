# Growtopia Multiboxing
this project is based on https://github.com/Blacklock/gtautofarmer 
and https://github.com/rvknth043/Global-Low-Level-Key-Board-And-Mouse-Hook

Basically i "fixed"-ish blacklock's multiboxing

well first of all i disabled the KeyboardHook since it was unnecessary for me, then fixed the active/deactive button aswell as adding hotkeys. simple stuff but useful (for me)
